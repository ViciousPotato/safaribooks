# safaribooks
Convert safaribooksonline ebook to epub and Kindle mobi format

# Usage
WARNING: use at your own risk.

## Installation

1. If you want Kindle mobi output, download kindlegen from Amazon and put the binary somewhere in PATH.

   If you only need epub books this step can be skipped.
   
2. Clone the safaribooks repo, let's say to `safaribooks/` directory.

3. Make sure you have Python 2 installed (Tested version Python 2.7) then run:

   `cd safaribooks`
   
   `pip install .`

   safaribooks is the folder you checkout the code.

4. Download a book (run this in the folder you checked out the code).

  `safaribooks -u USER/EMAIL -p PASSWORD -b BOOK_ID download-epub`.

   `BOOK_ID` is the id in url such as `9781617291920` in `https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/real-world-machine-learning/9781617291920/kindle_split_011.html`.

   An epub and a mobi file will be generated.


## Installation with docker

With credit to @jmagnusson

This should work no matter platform you're on as no dependencies other than `docker` needs to be installed.

1. Run `docker build -t safaribooks .`

2. Run `docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/converted:/app/converted safaribooks -u USER/EMAIL -p PASSWORD -b BOOK_ID download` and wait for it to complete

3. The .epub and .mobi should now be in the folder `converted` of your current working directory.
